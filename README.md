# Silent Auction

This Python program implements a silent auction system where users can enter their names and bid amounts to participate in an auction. The program finds the highest bidder and announces the winner at the end of the auction.

## Features

- Allows users to enter their names and bid amounts.
- Finds the highest bidder and announces the winner.
- Uses a simple command-line interface for user interaction.
- Clears the console between each bid to keep the interface clean.

## Instructions

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the silent auction program.
2. Enter your name when prompted: "What is your name?: "
3. Enter your bid amount when prompted: "What is your bid?: $"
4. If there are more bidders, type "yes" when prompted: "Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'."
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each bidder.
6. When there are no more bidders, type "no" to end the auction.
7. The program will announce the winner and their bid amount.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (used for clearing the console)

## Usage

```bash
python main.py

$ python main.py
